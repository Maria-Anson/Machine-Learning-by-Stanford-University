> 
> Some of the problems below are best addressed using a supervised learning algorithm, and the others with an unsupervised learning algorithm. Which of the following would you apply supervised learning to? (Select all that apply.) In each case, assume some appropriate dataset is available for your algorithm to learn from. 
> 

      Examine the statistics of two football teams, and predict which team will win tomorrow's match (given historical data of teams' wins/losses to learn from). 
> 
>  Examine a large collection of emails that are known to be spam email, to discover if there are sub-types of spam mail. 
> 

      Given genetic (DNA) data from a person, predict the odds of him/her developing diabetes over the next 10 years. 
> 
>  Take a collection of 1000 essays written on the US Economy, and find a way to automatically group these essays into a small number of groups of essays that are somehow "similar" or "related".

> 
> Which of these is a reasonable definition of machine learning? 
> 
>  Machine learning is the field of allowing robots to act intelligently. 
> 
>  Machine learning learns from labeled data. 
> 
>  Machine learning is the science of programming computers. 
> 

      Machine learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
